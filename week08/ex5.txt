A physical address is an address inside the real physical memory of some storage device.
A virtual address is an address inside an infinitely large virtual memory 
which is used to run programs which exceed the size of physical memory by moving pieces of address space between main memory and disk.

When a program runs, it occupies some virtual memory space that is specific to each program.
The OS is able to map the addresses of one memory to another.
