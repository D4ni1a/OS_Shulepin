When I tested my program with the example from the input.txt file, I noticed that the results depend on the number of page frames, as well as the number of bits in the counter.

I made two sequences 1 3 1 4 1 5 2 6 2 8 2 9 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and tested them for different values of page frames and counter.

For example, with 2 page frames and 8 bits per counter:
For sequence 1 3 1 4 1 5 2 6 2 8 2 9 the Hit/Miss ratio will be 0.5 and for sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 it will be 0. 
This happens because one and two occur three times for the first sequence, and they have such an order that by the time they are called again, they are already present in page frames. In the second sequence, however, by the time they are called again, the corresponding page is no longer contained in page frames, which leads to a higher number of misses.

For the same sequences run with 10 page frames and 8 bits per counter:
1 3 1 4 1 5 2 6 2 8 2 9 Hit/Miss ratio is 0.5, and for sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 - 1. 
This happens because one and two occur three times for the first sequence, and they have such an order that by the time they are called again, they are already contained in page frames. In the second sequence, however, by the time they are called again, any corresponding page is already contained in page frames, resulting in a lower number of misses.

Changing the number of bits for counter can also affect the result
For example, for sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 3 4 5 1 7 with 6 page frames and 4 bits in the counter, Hit/Miss rate is 0.444. And for the same sequence with 6 page frames and 8 bits in the counter - 0.625.
