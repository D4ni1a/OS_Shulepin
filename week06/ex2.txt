Comparing the output data of the FCFS algorithm and the SJF algorithm, one can notice that the average turnaround time and average waiting time for the processes scheduled by the second algorithm are usually smaller. 

Example:
Arrival time: 0 9 5 7 6 3 14
Burst time: 2 2 2 1 3 7 2

Average turnaround time FCFS: 7
Average waiting time FCFS: 4.29
Average turnaround time SJF: 6.29
Average waiting time SJF: 3.57

The reason for this is that with a large number of processes with a small burst time, they do not have to wait for long processes that came before them and with which they are waiting for the completion of another process. This reduces the turnaround time and waiting time for such processes and hence the averages.
